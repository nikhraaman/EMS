# Expense-Management-System
Expense Management System is a software solution that helps organizations track, manage, and analyze their expenses. Our project typically includes features for expense reporting, budget tracking and Reimbursement processing.
It can typically have 3 modules : - Associate Persona, Manager Persona and Finance Persona. But in this project due to time constraints, we have implemented 2 modules with some basic functionalities –

(A) Associate Persona 

	- Successful employee login
	- Associate can add an expense in the system
	- Able to categorize the expense
	- Able to add a receipt (Pdf, image [jpg/jpeg], etc.) 
	- To be able to check the status of their expense(Pending, Approved, Rejected)

(B) Manager Persona

	- Manager can get a list of all expenses, with their status 
	- Manager  can view the attached receipt
	- Manager can approve or reject an expense.
	- Manager can see the amount approved, rejected, pending for this month as a chart/graph
